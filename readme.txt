Attachments for BuddyPress Messages.

== Description ==

Allow your users to attach files to their BuddyPress Messages. Features:

- Allows for multiple attachments per message
- Attachment information appears in notification emails
- Access to attachments is protected, so they cannot be accessed by unauthorized users

Note that, at the moment, access protection requires Apache 2.x with AllowOverride enabled in httpd.conf.
